				<p><strong>Hi, my name is Shay.</strong> I was born and raised in the Midwest and am currently enjoying life in the Southwest. I enjoy learning and experiencing new things and I am currently taking advantage of my surroundings by picking up mountain biking. I also love traveling and will never turn down a chance to take a quick trip to the beach. In my free time I also own and operate a clothing business (<a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/SharkLifeClothingCo" target="_blank">Shark Life Clothing Co.</a>). This has been an excellent experience for me because it allows me to express my creative side, engage with my customers, and get my hands dirty by printing and pressing my own shirts.</p>
				<p><strong>A little more about me.</strong> As clich&#233 as it may sound, I truly am a believer in life-long learning. I believe success and knowledge are only limited by the time and effort that we put into it. I treat every opportunity to learn something new as a chance to strengthen my knowledge. I started my professional career with an exceptional opportunity in higher education, followed by several amazing years of growth and experience in both the financial investment and financial banking industries. </p>
				<p><strong>So, why development?</strong> I took some time to start thinking about what I was really looking for in the long-term. When I discovered and continued researching development, I was amazed. I was amazed at the seemingly endless tools and resources available to build and learn. I love building things and fixing things. I love building LEGO and in an odd way I look at development like building with LEGO. Each piece of code is like a LEGO block. With the right arrangement of blocks, you can build anything.</p>
				<p><strong>To sum it up, what I love the most about development is the limitless opportunity to grow my knowledge and experience and be in control of my own success.</strong></p>
